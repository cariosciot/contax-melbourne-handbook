# Cloud Tools
CONTAX Melbourne uses a number of cloud-based tools to manage and monitor our consulting workload.

## Outlook (Email)
https://outlook.office.com/owa
We use the full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools. To that end, our webmail provider is Outlook.

## CONTAX Portal (Timesheets, Expenses)
http://contax.com/Portal/
The CONTAX portal is where we go to fill out our timesheets and submit expense reports among other miscellaneous tasks. As consultants, our product is our time, so this is the most important tool we use.

## Freshservice (Ticketing)
https://contaxsap.freshservice.com
Our customers use Freshservice to open tickets and alert us of any issues or service requests that they may have.

## Dialpad (Telephone)
https://dialpad.com
We don't have phones on our desks, and for good reason. We're consultants who need to be able to be reached when we're on client sites, working remotely or in the office. Dialpad is an enterprise-grade VOIP app that enables us to do just that.

Dialpad is used company-wide at CONTAX, so it is your best option to reach resources in other offices.

## Slack (Chat)

## Trello (Workload Management/Kanban)
