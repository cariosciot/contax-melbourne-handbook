# Cloud Tools
CONTAX Melbourne uses a number of cloud-based tools to manage and monitor our consulting workload.

## Outlook (Email)
<https://outlook.office.com/owa>

We use the full suite of Microsoft Office 365 tools. To that end, our webmail provider is Outlook.

## CONTAX Portal (Timesheets, Expenses)
<https://portal.contax.cloud>

The CONTAX portal is where we go to fill out our timesheets and submit expense reports among other miscellaneous tasks. As consultants, our product is our time, so this is the most important tool we use.

## Basecamp (Project Management, Communication)
<https://3.basecamp.com/4400931/>

Basecamp is a lightweight project management application. We use it to keep all of our tasks and communications in one place while working on team projects. The structure is set up such that we can invite clients and coworkers alike to join in and work on projects with us. Feel free to do so. For the time being, Melbourne is the only CoE who uses Basecamp, though that is subject to change. Basecamp is administered by **Tim**. If you have any issues with Basecamp let him know and he'll lend a hand.

## Freshservice (Ticketing)
<https://contaxsap.freshservice.com>

Our customers use Freshservice to open tickets and alert us of any issues or service requests that they may have.

## Teams (Telephone)
<http://teams.microsoft.com>

We don't have phones on our desks, and for good reason. We're consultants who need to be able to be reached when we're on client sites, working remotely or in the office. Teams is an enterprise-grade VOIP app that enables us to do just that.

Teams is used company-wide at CONTAX, so it is your best option to reach resources in other offices.
