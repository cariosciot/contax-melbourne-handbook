# Paid Time Off Checklist

At CONTAX, we strongly emphasise a healthy work/life balance. One of the biggest factors in your ability to decompress is making the most of your paid time off. During the weeks leading up to a holiday, you should have already sent a request and received approval from your manager, and notified any clients with whom you have active projects underway. In addition to those steps, there are a few proactive actions you can undertake immediately before a holiday.

In order to ensure that your time off is in fact **off**, CONTAX suggests that you perform the following actions before beginning your holiday:

- Update the Melbourne shared calendar so that your fellow Melbourne CONTAXers know not to bother you while you're away.
- Put up an out of office auto-reply on your email letting customers and coworkers alike know that you're unreachable, the duration of your holiday, and where they can get assistance in the case of an emergency (typically calling the main line, or opening a ticket on freshservice).
- Re-assign your open freshservice tickets to an agent who will be available to follow up on them during your holiday.
- Arrange for someone to cover any recurring task for which you're responsible (daily/weekly checks, touchpoint meetings, etc...).
- Send a reminder email to any clients with whom you have frequent contact that you'll be away.
- Complete your timesheets for all the days that you'll be away.
- Set Dialpad to 'Do Not Disturb'.
- Disable push notifications on your phone for email, slack, and any other apps that you'd rather not be bothered by while you're away.
