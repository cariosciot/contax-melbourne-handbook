# Melbourne Office Dress
CONTAX Melbourne prides ourselves in the flexibility of our staff. We expect our team to be able to keep up with a fast-changing technology ecosystem. With that expectation of our team, it's only right that we allow our policies to progress quickly to keep up with and perhaps exceed the industry standard. Our people-focused workforce ought to have a people-focused dress code.

## On-site at Clients
Our relationships with our clients are the key to our business, so we always will show them the respect of dressing appropriately while on site. If you're unclear on what to wear to a client, default to the more formal end of *business casual*. If you're overdressed that first day, feel free to dial back your attire on any subsequent visits to match the standard in their workplace.

## In the Office
In the Melbourne office, we attempt to strike a balance between the level of professionalism that we we bring to our work, and creating a comfortable environment that is conducive to producing great work. While in the Melbourne office, it is expected that our employees dress professionally.

We trust your judgement, we really do. If you feel that your clothing is appropriate for the work we do, then CONTAX agrees.

On Fridays, we observe what is commonly referred to as **casual Friday** wherein we relax the dress code even further. Within reason, on Fridays, all bets are off. This can typically include, but is not limited to:
* Runners
* T-shirts
* Jeans
* Hoodies

## Summer Dress Code
Starting in the summer of 2019/2020, we are loosening our dress code even further. From 1 December 2019 until 29 February 2020, casual Friday will be extended earlier in the week. In order to fully enjoy our summer we will be observing **casual Thursday** as well as **casual Friday**.

In addition to casual days, we also encourage the wearing of non-ironic Hawaiian shirts on any day of the week out of nostalgic respect for Tom Selleck's portrayal of the titular character in [Magnum, P.I.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum,_P.I.).
