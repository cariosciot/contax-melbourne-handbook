# Melbourne Office Dress
CONTAX Melbourne prides ourselves in the flexibility of our staff. We expect our team to be able to keep up with a fast-changing technology ecosystem. With that expectation of our team, it's only right that we allow our policies to progress quickly to keep up with and perhaps exceed the industry standard. Our people-focused workforce ought to have a people-focused dress code.

## On-site at clients
Our relationships with our clients are the key to our business, so we always will show them the respect of dressing appropriately while on site. If you're unclear on what to wear to a client, default to the more formal end of *business casual*. If you're overdressed that first day, feel free to dial back your attire on any subsequent visits to match the standard in their workplace.
